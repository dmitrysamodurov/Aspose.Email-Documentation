## **Email Client Connections Optimization**

Users often encounter delays due to the default timeout settings, which can lead to prolonged connection times or even failed attempts.

To improve the efficiency of these connections, Aspose.Email for .NET offers properties like [Timeout](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/timeout/) and [GreetingTimeout](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/greetingtimeout/). While the `Timeout` property manages the overall duration for email operations, the `GreetingTimeout` property specifically targets the time it takes for the server to send a greeting string upon connection.

In the following section, we'll explore how to configure these settings to enhance your email client’s connection speed and reliability.

When using the `Timeout` property, it's important to note that the values assigned to it should have long enough intervals to accommodate lengthy operations.

However, relying solely on this property may cause connection establishment to take longer than expected. This can occur when the email client uses the automatic mode for connection establishment. In this mode, the client cycles through various connection parameters until a connection is established.

When connecting to SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 servers, a greeting string is sent to the client upon successful connection establishment. Servers may use implicit or explicit (START TLS) SSL/TLS connection initiation. In cases where the connection mode is mismatched (for example, the server is expecting an implicit SSL connection while the client tries to establish a non-secured or explicit SSL connection), the server will not send a greeting string.

As a result, the user may wait for an extended period until the timeout is reached, and the client moves on to the next connection option.

To address this issue, the [GreetingTimeout](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/greetingtimeout/) property has been introduced. This property allows users to set a timeout for the greeting string, reducing the time it takes to establish an automatic connection. By implementing the `GreetingTimeout` property, users can optimize their email client's performance and avoid lengthy wait times during connection establishment.

The following code sample shows how to set the [EmailClient.GreetingTimeout](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/greetingtimeout/) property:

```cs
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient("localhost", 25, "username", "password"))
{
    client.GreetingTimeout = 4000;
}
```

### **Retrieve Server Extensions**

The [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) lets you retrieve the server extensions that a server supports such as IDLE, UNSELECT, QUOTA, etc. This helps in identifying the availability of an extension before using the client for that particular functionality. The [GetCapabilities()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/getcapabilities/#getcapabilities) method returns the supported extension types in the form of a string array.

The following code snippet shows you how to retrieve server extensions.

### **Validate Mail Server Credentials Without Sending Emails**

Aspose.Email API provides the capability to validate mail server credentials without sending an email. It can be achieved with the [ValidateCredentials](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/validatecredentials/) method which is responsible for verifying the authenticity and correctness of the provided email credentials, which are normally used for authentication when connecting to the server.

It verifies that the provided email credentials, such as username and password, are valid, and that the client can establish a successful connection to the server. This verification of credentials helps ensure that the customer can access the email account securely and perform various operations, such as sending email.

```cs
using (SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(server.SmtpUrl, server.SmtpPort, "username", "password", SecurityOptions.Auto))
{
    client.Timeout = 4000;
   
    if (client.ValidateCredentials())
    {
        //to do something
    }
}
```

There is also a version of the method [ValidateCredentialsAsync](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/validatecredentialsasync/)  to perform an asynchronous operation.

## **Send Email via SOCKS Proxy Server**

In such cases, mail clients are not able to communicate over the Internet without specifying the proxy address. Aspose.Email provides support for versions 4, 4a and 5 of SOCKS proxy protocol. To send an email via a proxy server, perform the following steps:

1. Initialize Proxy with the required information, that is proxy address, port, and SOCKS version.
2. Initialize [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) with the host address, user name and password, and any other settings.
3. Set the client's Proxy property to the [Proxy](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/proxy/) object created earlier.

The following code snippet shows you how to connect to a server via proxy server.

## **Send Email via HTTP Proxy Server**

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "Examples-CSharp-SMTP-SendEmailViaHttpProxy-SendEmailViaHttpProxy.cs" >}}

## **Identify Authentication Methods for Secure SMTP Connection**

Aspose.Email offers properties allowing to check which authentication methods can be used for establishing a secure connection with the SMTP server before sending an email:

- the [SmtpClient.SupportedAuthentication](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/supportedauthentication/) property returns a list of authentication methods supported by the SMTP server.
- the [SmtpClient.AllowedAuthentication](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/allowedauthentication/) property returns a list of authentication methods defined by the user.

```cs
smtpClient.AllowedAuthentication = SmtpKnownAuthenticationType.Login;
```

## **Load SMTP Authentication Information from CONFIG File**

For Aspose.Email to be able to read a configuration file, it needs to be in the correct format. Below, we show an example XML configuration file followed by the code that reads it. The following code snippet shows you how to load SMTP authentication information from CONFIG File.

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "LoadingAuthenticationInformationFromAFile.xml" >}}

Once the configuration settings are defined, load these settings directly into an instance of the [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) class using one of its overloaded constructors. The following code snippet demonstrates reading configuration settings from the configuration file and loading them directly into the instance of the [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/).

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "Examples-CSharp-SMTP-LoadSmtpConfigFile-LoadSmtpConfigFile.cs" >}}

### **Bind SMTP Client to Specific IP Address**

The possibility of a host having multiple ports available for sending out emails cannot be ruled out. In such cases, the requirement may arise to bind the email sending client to a specific port on the host for sending out emails. This can be achieved with Aspose.Email API as well using the [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) [BindIPEndPoint](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/events/bindipendpoint) property. The API's [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) can be set to use a specific IP address on the host by specifying the specific IP Endpoint. The following code snippet shows you how to bind SMTP Client to Specific IP Address on Host.

{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "Examples-CSharp-SMTP-SetSpecificIpAddress-SetSpecificIpAddress.cs" >}}

### **Set Timeout for Mail Operations**

Each mail operation takes some time depending on many factors (network delays, data size, server performance, etc.). You can set a timeout for all mail operations. The code example below shows you how to do that using the [Timeout](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/timeout/) property.

Note: you should not set large values to avoid long waits in your application.

```csharp
using (SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient("host", 587, "username", "password", SecurityOptions.SSLExplicit))
{
    smtpClient.Timeout = 60000; // 60 seconds

    // some code...
}
```

### **Using Cryptographic Protocols**

Aspose.Email supports SSL (obsolete) and TLS cryptographic protocols to provide communications security. You can enable cryptographic encryption to protect data exchange between your application and mail servers.

> **_NOTE:_**  You should set only those versions of the protocol, which are supported by .NET Framework. If some versions of the cryptographic protocol are not supported by your current version of .NET Framework, they will be ignored and skipped. In this case, exceptions won't be generated. Please use [SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/setsupportedencryptionunsafe/#setsupportedencryptionunsafe) method if you want to set the protocols without any compatibility checks.

The code example below shows you how to set TLS 1.3 for [SmtpClient](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient/) class instance.

```csharp
using (SmtpClient smtpClient = new SmtpClient("host", 587, "username", "password", SecurityOptions.SSLExplicit))
{
    smtpClient.SupportedEncryption = EncryptionProtocols.Tls13;

    // some code...
}
```

In case of a specified encryption protocol is not supported in the current version of .NET Framework, the difference in behavior between [SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/setsupportedencryptionunsafe/#setsupportedencryptionunsafe) method and [SupportedEncryption](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/supportedencryption/) property is the following:

- If [SupportedEncryption](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/supportedencryption/) property is used, the email client downgrades the encryption protocol to a supported level.
- If [SetSupportedEncryptionUnsafe](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/setsupportedencryptionunsafe/#setsupportedencryptionunsafe) method is used, the email client throws exceptions.

### **SMTP Authentication with CRAM-MD5 Mechanism**

The CRAM-MD5 authentication mechanism of Aspose.Email for .NET provides an additional layer of security when accessing the server. The following code snippet shows how to implement this feature into your project:

```cs
smtpClient.AllowedAuthentication = SmtpKnownAuthenticationType.CramMD5;
```
