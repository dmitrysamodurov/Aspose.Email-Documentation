## **Track Document Conversion Progress**

Aspose.Email provides the facility to track the document conversion progress. For this, the API provides [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/customprogresshandler/). which represents the method that handles the progress events. The progress event types are represented by the [ProgressEventType](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/progresseventtype/) enumeration. The [ProgressEventType](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/progresseventtype/) enumeration has the following members.

- MimeStructureCreated: This event informs that the mime structure is created.
- MimePartSaved: This event informs that saving of one mime part is finished.
- SavedToStream: This event informs that all mime parts are saved to stream.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/customprogresshandler/) and [ProgressEventType](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/progresseventtype/) enumeration track the document conversion progress.

## **Render Hyperlinks with Custom Styles**

There may be times when you need to output hyperlinks with some specific style based on the requirements of your application. For that, Aspose.Email provides [HyperlinkRenderingCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/hyperlinkrenderingcallback/). You can pass the [HyperlinkRenderingCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/hyperlinkrenderingcallback/) as a parameter of [MailMessage.GetHtmlBodyText](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/gethtmlbodytext/#gethtmlbodytext).

The following code snippet shows you how to use [HyperlinkRenderingCallback](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/hyperlinkrenderingcallback/) to output hyperlinks using your own custom style.

## **Display Information in Custom Order in MHTML Files**

Aspose.Email provides [MhtSaveOptions.RenderingHeaders](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/headersformattingoptions/renderingheaders/) property which returns the list of headers for rendering. You can add the headers by using the [MhtTemplateName](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mhttemplatename/) class. The order in which the headers are added decides the order in which the information is displayed.

The following image compares the three outputs generated by the sample code.

The following code snippet demonstrates the use of [MhtSaveOptions.RenderingHeaders](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/headersformattingoptions/renderingheaders/) property to set the order in which the information is displayed in the output MHTML files.
