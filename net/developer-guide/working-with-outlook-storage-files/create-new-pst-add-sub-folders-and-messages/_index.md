As well as parsing an existing PST file, Aspose.Email provides the means to create a PST file from scratch. This article demonstrates how to create an Outlook PST file and add a subfolder to it.

1. [Creating a new PST file](#creating-a-new-pst-file).
1. [Changing Container class of a folder](#changing-a-folders-container-class).
1. [Add Bulk Messages with Improved Performance](#add-bulk-messages-with-improved-performance) 

## **Creating a new PST file**

Use the [PersonalStorage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/) class to create a PST file at some location on a local disk. To create a PST file from scratch:

1. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.Create()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/create/#create/) method.
1. Add a sub-folder at the root of the PST file by accessing the Root folder and then calling the [AddSubFolder](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/addsubfolder/#addsubfolder/) method.

The following code snippet shows you how to create a PST file and add a subfolder called Inbox.

```csharp
// Create new PST
using var pst = PersonalStorage.Create(path, FileFormatVersion.Unicode);

// Add new folder "Test"
pst.RootFolder.AddSubFolder("Inbox");
    
```

## **Changing the Folder Container Class**

Sometimes it is necessary to change the folder container class. A common example is where messages of different types (appointments, messages, etc.) are added to the same folder. In such cases, the folder class needs to be changed for all elements in the folder to display properly. The following code snippet shows you how to change the container class of a folder in PST for this purpose.

```csharp
using var pst = PersonalStorage.FromFile("PersonalStorage1.pst);
var folder = pst.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("Inbox");

folder.ChangeContainerClass("IPF.Note");
```

## **Add Bulk Messages with Improved Performance**

Adding individual messages to a PST implies more I/O operations to the disc and may slow down the performance. To improve the performance, messages can be added to the PST in the bulk mode to minimize I/O operations.
The [AddMessages](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/addmessages/) method allows you to add messages in bulk and can be used as in the following scenarios. In addition, the [MessageAdded](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/messageadded/) event occurs when a message is added to the folder.

### **Add Messages from Another PST**

To add messages from another PST, use the [FolderInfo.EnumerateMapiMessages](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/enumeratemapimessages/) method that returns `IEnumerable<MapiMessage>`:

```csharp
using var srcPst = PersonalStorage.FromFile(@"source.pst", false);
using var destPst = PersonalStorage.FromFile(@"destination.pst");

// Get the folder by name
var srcFolder = srcPst.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("SomeFolder");
var destFolder = destPst.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("SomeFolder");

destFolder.MessageAdded += new MessageAddedEventHandler(OnMessageAdded);
destFolder.AddMessages(srcFolder.EnumerateMapiMessages());


// Handles the MessageAdded event.
static void OnMessageAdded(object sender, MessageAddedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Added: {e.EntryId}");
}
```

### **Add Messages from Directory**

To add messages from directory, create the `GetMessages(string pathToDir)` named iterator method that returns `IEnumerable<MapiMessage>`:

```csharp
using var pst = PersonalStorage.FromFile(@"storage.pst");
var folder = pst.RootFolder.GetSubFolder("SomeFolder");
folder.MessageAdded += OnMessageAdded;
folder.AddMessages(GetMessages(@"MessageDirectory"));

// Named iterator method to read messages from directory.
static IEnumerable<MapiMessage> GetMessages(string pathToDir)
{
    string[] files = Directory.GetFiles(pathToDir, "*.msg");

    foreach (var file in files)
    {
        yield return MapiMessage.Load(file);
    }
}

// Handles the MessageAdded event.
static void OnMessageAdded(object sender, MessageAddedEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Added: {e.EntryId}");
}
```
