Aspose.Email for .NET provides robust capabilities to convert email messages stored in MBOX format to various other formats. The library supports conversions to formats such as EML, EMLX, HTML, ICS, MHT, MHTML, MSG, OFT, OST, PST, TIFF, VCF, and XPS. Below, we provide detailed steps and code examples for converting MBOX files to these formats. For this purpose, Aspose.Email offers a robust set of features:

1. The [MboxrdStorageReader](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxrdstoragereader/) class is used to read messages from an MBOX file and retrieve the total count of email messages. It provides methods to access individual messages stored in the file.

2. The [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/) class represents an email message. It supports loading and saving email messages in various formats and provides rich functionality to manipulate their properties.

3. The [SaveOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/) class specifies the options to use when saving an email message. It contains both predefined options and customization options for saving messages in different formats.

## **Convert MBOX to EML**

EML files are used by several email clients to store email messages in plain text. Converting MBOX to EML allows for easy transfer and reading of email messages.

Below is the sample code demonstrating the conversion of MBOX to EML:

1. Create an instance of MboxrdStorageReader for the specified MBOX file ("sourceFile.mbox").
2. Use the [reader.GetTotalItemsCount()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxrdstoragereader/gettotalitemscount/) method to iterate through all emails in the file to get the total number of items starting from 0.
3. Read each message using the [reader.ReadNextMessage()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxrdstoragereader/readnextmessage/#readnextmessage) method.
4. Save each email as a .eml file with a unique name ("outputMessage"+i+".eml") using [SaveOptions.DefaultEml](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/defaulteml/).

```cs
using (var reader = new MboxrdStorageReader("sourceFile.mbox", false)){
	for (int i = 0; i < reader.GetTotalItemsCount(); i++){
		using (var message = reader.ReadNextMessage()){
			message.Save("outputMessage"+i+".eml", SaveOptions.DefaultEml);
		}
	}
}
```

## **Convert MBOX to EMLX**

For this type of conversion, use the same approach given above [Convert MBOX to EML](#convert-mbox-to-eml). However, when saving a message in EMLX format, choose [SaveOptions.DefaultEmlx](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/defaultemlx/).

```cs
using (var reader = new MboxrdStorageReader("sourceFile.mbox", false)){
	for (int i = 0; i < reader.GetTotalItemsCount(); i++){
		using (var message = reader.ReadNextMessage()){
			message.Save("outputMessage"+i+".emlx", SaveOptions.DefaultEmlx);
		}
	}
}
```

## **Convert MBOX to HTML**

HTML format is widely used for displaying emails in web browsers. Converting MBOX to HTML allows for viewing emails in a web-friendly format.

The following code sample demonstrates how to read messages from an MBOX file and save each message as an HTML file.

7. Save each email message as an HTML file using the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/save/#save_3) method of the [MailMessage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/) class. Pass the file path and save options as parameters.

```cs
// Load mbox file
var mbox = MboxStorageReader.CreateReader(mboxFilePath, new MboxLoadOptions());
// Ensure the output directory exists
Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);
// Iterate through mbox messages and save them as .html files
int count = 1;
foreach (var eml in mbox.EnumerateMessages())
{
    // Save each message as .html file
    var htmlFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, $"Message{count}.html");
    var htmlSaveOptions = new HtmlSaveOptions
    {
        ResourceRenderingMode = ResourceRenderingMode.SaveToFile,
        UseRelativePathToResources = true
    };
    eml.Save(htmlFilePath, htmlSaveOptions);

2. Create an output directory if it doesn't exist.
3. Initialize message counter.
4. Iterate through each email message (eml) in the MBOX file using [mbox.EnumerateMessages()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxstoragereader/enumeratemessages/#enumeratemessages). This method returns each message as a MailMessage object.
5. Use the [Save](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/mailmessage/save/#save_3) method to save each email as an OFT file at the specified file path. The [SaveOptions.DefaultOft](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email/saveoptions/defaultoft/) ensures that the email message is converted and saved in the OFT format with default options.

```cs
var mbox = MboxStorageReader.CreateReader(mboxFilePath, new MboxLoadOptions());

Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);

int count = 1;

foreach (var eml in mbox.EnumerateMessages())
{
    // Save each message as .oft file
    var oftFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, $"Message{count}.oft");
    eml.Save(oftFilePath, SaveOptions.DefaultOft);
```

## **Convert MBOX to OST**

An OST (Offline Storage Table) format is a data file used by Microsoft Outlook to store copies of mailbox items from an Exchange server, enabling offline access and synchronization with the server when connected.

This component, configured with [MboxLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxloadoptions/), parses the MBOX file and prepares to extract messages.
2. Once messages are extracted, a [PersonalStorage](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/#personalstorage-class) instance is created using [FromFile](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/fromfile/#fromfile) method, targeting the OST file specified by ostFilePath. 
3. Within this OST file, the Inbox folder (retrieved via [GetPredefinedFolder](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/getpredefinedfolder/)) is identified as the destination folder for converted messages.
4. Iteratively, each message in the MBOX file is processed using [mbox.EnumerateMessages()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxstoragereader/enumeratemessages/#enumeratemessages). For each message, it undergoes transformation into a MapiMessage object using [MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(eml)](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage/frommailmessage/#frommailmessage_3), where eml represents the extracted email in MailMessage format. 
5. Finally, each MapiMessage is added to the Inbox folder within the OST file using [folderInfo.AddMessage(msg)](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/addmessage/).

```cs
var mbox = MboxStorageReader.CreateReader(mboxFilePath, new MboxLoadOptions());

using (var ost = PersonalStorage.FromFile(ostFilePath))
{
    var folderInfo = ost.GetPredefinedFolder(StandardIpmFolder.Inbox);

    foreach (var eml in mbox.EnumerateMessages())
    {
        var msg = MapiMessage.FromMailMessage(eml);
        folderInfo.AddMessage(msg);
    }
} 
```

Aspose.Email for .NET provides a robust solution for converting MBOX files to XPS format which involves reading an MBOX file and converting each email message to an XPS document. The following code snippet demonstrates how to implement this feature into your project: 

1. Use the [CreateReader](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxstoragereader/createreader/#createreader_2) method of the [MboxStorageReader](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxstoragereader/#mboxstoragereader-class) class to read the MBOX file, specifying the file path and load options with [MboxLoadOptions](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxloadoptions/).
2. Ensure the output directory for the XPS files exists, creating it if necessary.
3. Iterate through each email message in the MBOX file using the [mbox.EnumerateMessages()](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.mbox/mboxstoragereader/enumeratemessages/#enumeratemessages).
4. Construct the file path for each XPS file, naming them sequentially as "Message1.xps", "Message2.xps", etc.
5. Initialize Mail Printer to handle the conversion of email messages to XPS format.
6. Configure Printer properties to ensure the email content is formatted correctly:
    - [FormattingFlags](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.printing/mailprinter/formattingflags/#mailprinterformattingflags-property) ensures that mail information (like sender, recipient, etc.) is included in the output.
    - [PageUnit](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.printing/mailprinter/pageunit/) sets the unit of measure for the printer settings to centimeters.
    - [AutoFitWidth](https://reference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.printing/messageformattingflags/#messageformattingflags-enumeration) ensures the content width is adjusted to fit the page.
7. Use the last line to convert the email message to an XPS file and save it to the specified path.

```cs
var mbox = MboxStorageReader.CreateReader(mboxFilePath, new MboxLoadOptions());

Directory.CreateDirectory(outputDirectory);

int count = 1;

foreach (var eml in mbox.EnumerateMessages())
{
    var xpsFilePath = Path.Combine(outputDirectory, $"Message{count}.xps");

    var printer = new Printing.MailPrinter();

    printer.FormattingFlags = Printing.MessageFormattingFlags.MailInfo;

    printer.PageUnit = Printing.PrinterUnit.Cm;

    printer.Print(eml, xpsFilePath, Printing.PrintFormat.XPS);

    Console.WriteLine($"Message {count} saved as: {xpsFilePath}");

    count++;
}
```
